# talk-talk

Talk-talk is a simple real-time chat with image/text messages. After autharization on the main screen you can find all people registered in the talk-talk chat. If you want to chat with someone just send a request and it will appear on the "waiting chats" area for that person. That person can whether accept or decline your request. If request accepted new chat will appear in "active chats" area for both of you. 

This project made with MVC design pattern. I use Firebase as a backend service. Design was the first thing I made working on this project. It was made in Sketch.
